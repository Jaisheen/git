Once upon a time there was a farmer, he had three sons and they always kept fighting. The farner was very worried about them, when the farmer was in his death bed he wanted to teach his sons a lesson; so he called his sons and told them to get a bunch of sticks. He told them to take one each and break it and he said if you kept fighting you could easily get sepearted and if you are together no one can defeat. 
So the moral of the story is to stay together and be strong.
